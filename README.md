## Environmental Health Hazards and Threats (EHHTs)

Over the summer of 2024 I worked alongside a team of student and faculty researchers from Willamette's Public Health and Environmental Science departments to complete a community health assessment concerning climate change resilience in Marion and Polk Counties, OR. I was charged with analyzing the results of a survey which was distributed among the counties' communities and garnered over 600 responses. 

### Key findings:

The past EHHTs that had the highest general impact (encompassing overall disruptions to daily life) on the community were the 2021 winter storm and a period of poor air quality caused by wildfire smoke in 2020. These events, along with the 2021 heat wave, also impacted a much larger swath of the community than localized events such as wildfires. Health impacts of these events were generally less clear, but the 2020 wildfire smoke episode was cited as having a significant impact by the largest proportion of respondents.

Community members were also asked about their concern for future events. These results mirror what we found about impact: respondents were most concerned about wildfire smoke and air quality (72% and 65%, respectively, of respondents chose a 4 or 5 on a Likert scale for these events). Over half of respondents also indicated that they were very concerned about weather-related power outages (58%), severe winter storms (60%), long and hot summers (59%), heatwaves (55%), and wildfires (55%). Events that were of less concern included poor water quality, high levels of pollen, drought, vector-borne diseases, and flooding, indicating that more community education is needed surrounding these events given that they are only going to get worse in the future.

When asked to provide information about a specific event, both the 2020 wildfire smoke event and 2021 winter storm received over 150 responses, demonstrating just how serious these events were for those who experienced them.

Included in the event-specific section were two questions asking respondents to rate the helpfulness and how difficult it was to find information released about a given event. We found that the difficulty and helpfulness ratings were generally correlated across events, suggesting that information that is more readily available may also be easier to understand (or vice versa). Certain events were harder to find information about than others, including the 2018 Detroit Lake algal bloom, 2021 wildfires, and 2021 winter storm; however relatively few respondents indicated that information for any event was actively difficult to locate.

## Racial Differences in *FIFA* Stats

During the Spring 2025 semester I studied abroad in the UK! While there, I took a class on football (soccer) and society. For one of my assignments for that class, I looked into how football/soccer players' stats differ in *FIFA* based on race.

This first graph is based on data gathered by [Campbell & Maloney](https://doi.org/10.1080/14660970.2022.2109805), who analyzed the skill distributions of *FIFA 20*'s top 100-ranked players. I plotted the average difference they found in each skill between Black and white players; this shows that Black players uniformly outperformed white players in defending and physicality - two overall skill groups that are primarily based on physical prowess - as well as every skill which was individually categorized as "physical" type. However, in every category except defending, white players' technical skills were rated more highly than Black players'.

I also plotted data gathered by [Anderson](https://doi.org/10.1177/21674795231190398), who took a slightly different approach by categorizing players in *FIFA 23* along a continuum of light, medium, or dark skin tone. This complicates the binary representations of the original study, which did not leave room for the effects of colorism or stereotyping about other races. By using a continuum, Anderson revealed that medium-skinned players actually performed *better* on average than white athletes in the mental skills category, while dark-skinned athletes were rated significantly worse than both light- and medium-skinned players; however, both medium- and dark-skinned players performed better than light-skinned players in all physical skill categories, with dark-skinned players being rated the highest. These results suggest that proximity to whiteness plays a significant role in how athletes' play is characterized.

## Fall Data Challenge 2024

In 2024 I worked with a team of two other students to compete in the Fall Data Challenge, which tasked teams with analyzing police call data. We chose to focus on arson-related calls from Portland and Seattle in 2023.

***

<img width="1124" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50352cbe-d01e-4873-aad5-e961703dcdb9" />

Our initial finding was that Seattle had had significantly more arson calls than Portland, even when adjusted for population using 2020 census data. This was somewhat surprising, as the cities are usually considered pretty comparable to each other. We wondered whether the cities would have any other major differences or similarities in reporting patterns...

<img width="1112" height="634" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d807a36c-0916-45de-b061-b1522224fbe6" />

...So we next looked into the distribution of arson calls across the months of 2023. Interestingly, though the initial pattern certainly holds - Seattle *always* had more calls in any given month than Portland - the cities followed very similar call patterns across time. In both cities, calls fell from the beginning of the year until Feb/March, rose until April/May, fell again in June, peaked in July, then fell once again until a smaller uptick in November. This suggests that similar factors (likely weather-related) may have influenced the number of calls made in a given month.

Finally, we investigated the spatial distribution of arson calls. What's fascinating here is that while both cities appeared to have clusters of calls near their downtown areas, Seattle also has a cluster that extends southward from its downtown along MLK Jr. way, which is a highway between two neighborhoods. Both of these spatial groupings suggest that industrial/commercialized areas may be more likely to be targeted by arson.

***

Of course, there are several caveats to these data - calls made don't necessarily represent actual numbers of arsons, we had no way of tracking whether the same individual was committing multiple arsons, calls may have simply been about fires and were mislabelled, etc. With all of that being said, we still had a lot of fun and gained some insight into arson patterns in these two cities! Our major recommendation was that both cities figure out what's going on in July to cause such a massive peak, and find some way to prevent whatever it is.
