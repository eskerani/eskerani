## Environmental Health Hazards and Threats (EHHTs)

Over the summer of 2024 I worked alongside a team of student and faculty researchers from Willamette's Public Health and Environmental Science departments to complete a community health assessment concerning climate change resilience in Marion and Polk Counties, OR. I was charged with analyzing the results of a survey which was distributed among the counties' communities and garnered over 600 responses. 

### Key findings:

The past EHHTs that had the highest general impact (encompassing overall disruptions to daily life) on the community were the 2021 winter storm and a period of poor air quality caused by wildfire smoke in 2020. These events, along with the 2021 heat wave, also impacted a much larger swath of the community than localized events such as wildfires. Health impacts of these events were generally less clear, but the 2020 wildfire smoke episode was cited as having a significant impact by the largest proportion of respondents.

Community members were also asked about their concern for future events. These results mirror what we found about impact: respondents were most concerned about wildfire smoke and air quality (72% and 65%, respectively, of respondents chose a 4 or 5 on a Likert scale for these events). Over half of respondents also indicated that they were very concerned about weather-related power outages (58%), severe winter storms (60%), long and hot summers (59%), heatwaves (55%), and wildfires (55%). Events that were of less concern included poor water quality, high levels of pollen, drought, vector-borne diseases, and flooding, indicating that more community education is needed surrounding these events given that they are only going to get worse in the future.

When asked to provide information about a specific event, both the 2020 wildfire smoke event and 2021 winter storm received over 150 responses, demonstrating just how serious these events were for those who experienced them.

Included in the event-specific section were two questions asking respondents to rate the helpfulness and how difficult it was to find information released about a given event. We found that the difficulty and helpfulness ratings were generally correlated across events, suggesting that information that is more readily available may also be easier to understand (or vice versa). Certain events were harder to find information about than others, including the 2018 Detroit Lake algal bloom, 2021 wildfires, and 2021 winter storm; however relatively few respondents indicated that information for any event was actively difficult to locate.

If you would like to go even more in-depth or look at the findings for individual events, the final report from this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxCkrpYy_8Cn3iKEdeXQWzPdU-dWD5UZ/edit?tab=t.0)!
